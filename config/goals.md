# MacPilot Improvement Goals

Write your improvement requests here. The meta-agent reads this file on every run
and treats each bullet or section as an independent goal.

<!-- Example goals (uncomment and edit to use):

## Agents
- Add a new agent that checks for outdated Swift package dependencies
- The triage-bugs agent should group errors by module before writing the report

## Prompts
- test-xcode-project prompt should include the scheme name in the report title
- All agents should mention the git commit SHA they ran against

## Schedules
- Run the test agent twice a day (morning and evening) instead of once

## General
- Add a health-check agent that verifies all other agents ran recently
- Reduce max-turns on triage agents from 10 to 8
